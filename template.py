Text Adventure Demo by Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

This program is a small text-adventure game that demonstrates the cmd
and textwrap Python modules. You can find other tutorials like this at
http://inventwithpython.com/blog

The tutorial for this game program is located at: TODO
The github repo for this program is at: TODO


This tutorial does not use classes and object-oriented programming
in order to make it simpler to understand for new programmers. Although
you can see how using dictionaries-in-dictionaries to structures your
data quickly gets unwieldy.

The same goes for using global variables and functions such as inventory,
location, and moveDirection(). These are fine for a small program,
but if you ever want to extend the game they can become burdensome to
work with. But if you are starting out with a toy project, they're fine.
"""


"""
First, we will create some data structures for our game world.

The town looks something like this:

        +---------+    +---------+
        | Thief   O    | Bakery  |
        | Guild   |    |         |
+------++------O--+    +----O----+
| Used |
|Anvils|        Town Square     +--------+
|      O                        |Obs Deck|
+------++----O----+    +----O----/  /
        | Black-  O    | Wizard /  /
        | smith   |    | Tower    /
        +---------+    +---------+
"""


"""
These constant variables are used because if I mistype them, Python will
immediately throw up an error message since no variable with the typo
name will exist. If we mistyped the strings, the bugs that it produces
would be harder to find.
"""
DESC = 'desc'
NORTH = 'north'
SOUTH = 'south'
EAST = 'east'
WEST = 'west'
UP = 'up'
DOWN = 'down'
GROUND = 'ground'

"""
The game world data is stored in a dictionary (which itself has dictionaries
and lists). Python's normal rules of indentation are suspended when typing out
a dictionary value until it encounters the closing curly brace, which is
helpful for us to make the dictionary value readable.

Each dictionary value inside the world variable is a different area in the
game world. The key is a string (i.e. 'Town Square') that is the reference
name of the location. It will also be displayed as the title of the area.

The value is another dictionary, which has keys 'desc', 'north', 'south',
'east', 'west', 'up', 'down', 'shop', and 'ground'. We use the constant
variables (e.g. DESC, NORTH, etc.) instead of strings in case we make
typos.

DESC is a text description of the area. SHOP, if it exists, is a list of
items that can be bought at this area. (We don't implement money in this
program, so everything is free.) GROUND is a list of items that are on
the ground in this area. The directions (NORTH, SOUTH, UP, etc.) are the
areas that exist in that direction.

This is the index of all possible items in the game world. Note that These
key-value pairs are more like blueprints than actual items. The actual
items exist in the GROUND value in an area's entry in the world variable.

The GROUNDDESC value is a short string that displays in the area's description.
The SHORTDESC value is a short string that will be used in sentences like, "You
drop X." or "You buy X."
The LONGDESC value is displayed when the player looks at the item.
The TAKEABLE Boolean value is True if the player can pick up the item and put
it in their inventory.
The DESCWORDS value is a list of strings that can be used in the player's
commands. For example, if this is ['welcome', 'sign'] then the player can type
a command such as "take sign" or "look welcome".
The TAKEABLE value is True if the item can be picked up off the ground. If
this key doesn't exist, it defaults to True.
The EDIBLE value is True if the item can be eaten. If this key doesn't exist,
it defaults to False.
